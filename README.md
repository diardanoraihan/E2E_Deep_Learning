## Project Summary
Imagine we need to deal with lots of real-world clothes images and your responsibility is to create an automated image classifier for an e-commerce company. As a result, the challenge is not only to build a robust deep learning model, but also to deploy it as a __serverless app__. We can combine the __AWS Lambda__ and __API Gateway__ for hosting this serverless APIs. 

In this project, we will learn together how to:
- __train a deep learning model__ to classify images using TensorFlow.
- __convert the model into a more size-efficient__ format using TensorFlow Lite.
- __deploy the model locally__ on our machine using Docker.
- __deploy the model as a REST API__ using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.


## Datasets
The dataset contains 3781 clothes images with the top 10 most popular categories, divided into the train, test, and validation sets. We can access the data [here](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset-small).
| Label | Dataset Size | Train Size | Test Size | Validation Size | 
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------------:|:------------:|:----------:|

| `outwear`     | 246       | 184                  | 38        | 24       |
| `pants`       | 559       | 468                  | 42        | 49       |
| `shirt`       | 345       | 290                  | 26        | 29       |
| `shoes`       | 297       | 198                  | 73        | 26       |
| `shorts`      | 257       | 202                  | 30        | 25       |
| `skirt`       | 136       | 112                  | 12        | 12       |
| `t-shirt`     | 928       | 795                  | 52        | 81       |
| __TOTAL__     | 3781      | 3068                 | 372       | 341      |

## The Proposed Deep Learning Model
We will build a deep learning model using the transfer learning method and image augmentation to achieve a good performance and prevent overfitting. The pre-trained model we use is __InceptionV3__, but feel free to experiment with another model as well.

You can see the process in [1_Model_Training.ipynb](https://github.com/diardanoraihan/E2E_Deep_Learning/blob/main/1_Model_Training.ipynb)
- The sample result of an image being augmented is shown below.

- Model training:  
  - Classification accuracy on test dataset: __90.59%__
  - Gap accuracy between test and training dataset: __3.04%__ (test acc > training acc)
  - Test loss: __0.273__
  - Avoid overvitting: __YES__

## Model Conversion with TensorFlow Lite
After we build the model using TensorFlow, we will soon notice that the file size is too large and not optimized for deployment, especially on mobile or edge devices. This is where TensorFlow Lite (__TFLite__) comes into play. TFLite will help us convert the model to a more efficient format in `.tflite`. This will generate a small binary-sized model that is lightweight, low-latency and having a minor impact on accuracy.

You can see the process in [2_Model_Conversion.ipynb](https://github.com/diardanoraihan/E2E_Deep_Learning/blob/main/2_Model_Conversion.ipynb)

## Model Deployment
In this final step, we will deploy the model using Docker, AWS Lambda, and AWS API Gateway. You can see the process in [3_Model_Deployment.ipynb](https://github.com/diardanoraihan/E2E_Deep_Learning/blob/main/3_Model_Deployment.ipynb)

### Deploy on Local Machine with Docker
Here are the screenshots of running the model locally with Docker:

### Deploy on AWS Lambda and API Gateway
- The URL to make an HTTP API call: https://xw2bv0y8mb.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test/predict
- Image data to be sent as a POST request:
```
{
    "url": "https://tinyurl.com/clothes-t-shirt"
}
```
- To make a prediction, we can use __Postman app__, [Reqbin](https://reqbin.com/), or via terminal (i.e. Git Bash):
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diardanoraihan/E2E_Deep_Learning/main/Visualization/aws%20post%20request.jpg" width="800">

```
$ curl -d '{"url": "https://tinyurl.com/clothes-t-shirt"}' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
https://xw2bv0y8mb.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test/predict
```

## Conclusion
Conducting an end-to-end deep learning project can be challenging due to the many procedures to follow. However, thanks to the rich features of TensorFlow, we can build and deploy the model with ease. The presence of services such as Docker and AWS helps data scientists to quickly deliver the app either offline or online to solve business problems.

Using the serverless clothes image classifier as an example, I hope this project gives you a basic idea of how to deal with a similar case in the future. Keep inspiring!

Thank you,
