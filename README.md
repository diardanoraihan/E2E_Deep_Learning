## Project Summary
Imagine we need to deal with lots of real-world clothes images and your responsibility is to create an automated image classifier for an e-commerce company. As a result, the challenge is not only we need to build a robust deep learning model, but also deploy it as a __serverless app__ to only focus on the business solution, not the heavy-lifting infrastructure that hosts the app. The combination of __AWS Lambda__ and __API Gateway__ can be used for hosting serverless APIs. 

In this project, we will learn together how to:
- __train a deep learning model__ to classify images using TensorFlow.
- __convert the model into a more size-efficient__ format using TensorFlow Lite.
- __deploy the model locally__ on our machine using Docker.
- __deploy the model as a REST API__ using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
