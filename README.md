## Project Summary
Imagine we need to deal with lots of real-world clothes images and your responsibility is to create an automated image classifier for an e-commerce company. As a result, the challenge is not only to build a robust deep learning model, but also to deploy it as a __serverless app__. We can combine the __AWS Lambda__ and __API Gateway__ for hosting this serverless APIs. 

In this project, we will learn together how to:
- __train a deep learning model__ to classify images using TensorFlow.
- __convert the model into a more size-efficient__ format using TensorFlow Lite.
- __deploy the model locally__ on our machine using Docker.
- __deploy the model as a REST API__ using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.


## Datasets
The dataset contains 3781 clothes images with the top 10 most popular categories, divided into the train, test, and validation sets. We can access the data [here](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset-small).
